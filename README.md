NOTES!
This autoclicker is a beta release and may contain bugs. We will be regularly updating the software to fix any issues and improve its performance. 
The current version of the autoclicker is 1.0.
This application is designed specifically for Growtopia players and contains a variety of useful features.
The multipoint autoclicker allows you to click multiple points on your screen at the same time, while the click delay and duration controls give you precision 
over your clicks. The application also supports controls for left, right, middle and scroll buttons, as well as arrow keys on certain mouses.
In the future, we plan to update the application to include a fully customizable user interface and the ability to add hotkeys for even greater convenience.
